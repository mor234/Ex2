# Ex2 -directinal weighted graph, gui and game algorithm
This project was done as an assignment for students in an object-oriented programming course.

In this project a weighted directed graph data structure is implemented.
A number of algorithms are implemented on the directed and weighted graphs,
Including the ability to save and restore the graph from a Json format file, calculate a very short directed trajectory, test
Intentional connectivity and more.

In the second phase of the project, we will use the structure of the data and algorithms to realize the "Pokemon Challenge" game - which includes processes, a graphical interface, and an automated system for playing against
"Server".
