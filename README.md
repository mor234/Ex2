# Ex2 -directinal weighted graph, gui and game algorithm
>This project was done as an assignment for students in an object-oriented programming course.

>In this project a weighted directed graph data structure is implemented.
>A number of algorithms are implemented on the directed and weighted graphs,
>Including the ability to save and restore the graph from a Json format file, calculate a very short directed trajectory, test
>Intentional connectivity and more.

>In the second parte of the project, we will use the structure of the data and algorithms to realize the "Pokemon Challenge" game - which includes processes, a graphical >interface, and an automated system for playing against
>"Server".
